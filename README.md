# Optimization on GoogleEarth
## What is this?
This is optimization program. Optimized value is elevation at the Earth.

So I used GoogleElevation API and GoogleEarth API.

This includes two optimization methods - NelderMead method, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

## How to run?
1. Install GoogleEarth Plugin to your browser
2. Run NelderMead/nelder_mead.html or ParticleSwarm/particle_swarm.html
